## 5. Code Examples

This is a _python_ code that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function:

```py
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example: Calculate the factorial of 5
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {result}")
```

And this is a _javascript_ function to change the page into dark mode:

```js
// Get a reference to the body element
const body = document.body;

// Function to toggle dark mode
function toggleMode() {
  body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
}

// Add event listener to the button for toggling mode
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const toggleButton = document.getElementById("toggleButton");
  toggleButton.addEventListener("click", toggleMode);
});
```
